##freeablo source documentation

This site is a listing of code documentation for the freeablo project.
Most of it is automatically generated from the freeablo source code, and special
comments embedded in it. However, there are a few manually written bits too:

- @ref md_docs_overall_architecture
- @ref md_docs_multiplayer

Also, as freeablo was originally a college final year project, my report
document for the project is also available at https://github.com/wheybags/fyp.
It is somewhat out of date, but has some valubale information in it.

[decisions.md](@ref md_decisions) contains a list of significant decisions taken over the project's lifetime.
